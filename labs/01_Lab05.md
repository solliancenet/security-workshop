# Day 1 - Lab 6 - Multi-factor Authentication and One Time Passwords

DevIntersection Security Workshop

## Exercise 1: How MFA one time token really works

Learn how MFA one time token works.

## Task 1: Generate MFA Password

1. Open your [Azure Active Directory portal](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/UserManagement/MultifactorVerification.aspx?BrandContextID=O365)
2. Select your account
3. Select **Enable**
4. In the dialog, select **enable multi-factor auth**, then select **close**

    ![Enable MFA.](media/enable-multifactor-auth.png "Enable MFA")

5. Open a new browser window, login as your user account to the Azure Portal

    ![More info required](media/more-info-required.png "More info required")

6. Select **Next**

   ![Verification required](media/additional-security-verification.png "Verification required")

7. Select **Mobile App**, then select **Use verification code**
8. Select **Set up**
9. In the dialog, select **Configure app without notifications**

    ![Configure Mobile App](media/configure-mobile-app.png "Configure Mobile App")

10. Copy the code displayed, this is effectively a second password

    ![Configure Mobile App, copy the secret key](media/configure-mobile-app-2.png "Copy the secret key")

### Task 2: Setup MFA Authenticator App

1. Download the Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator App
2. Scan the bar code displayed, you should see it display the 60 second one time password:

    ![60 second code is displayed](media/google-authenticator.png "60 second code is displayed")

### Task 3: Generate code manually

1. Download the `c:/labfiles/security-workshop/artifacts/GenerateToken.ps1` Powershell script

2. Open a PowerShell ISE and open the `GenerateToken.ps1`

3. Replace the account value with the secret key you received from the Azure AD Portal, remove any spaces

4. Press **F5**, you should see the same value as in your authenticator application

    ![PowerShell result](media/generate-token.png "PowerShell result is displayed")

    > **NOTE** MFA with Token Generation is really just a second password. If a hacker were to get this second password\secret, they could generate the tokens.

## Exercise 2: Protecting yourself from SIM Card swap (Take home assignment)

### Task 1 : Change your SIM Card (TMobile)

1. Explore your mobile provider's site, determine how you can change your SIM card.

2. Notice that most allow you to change the card through their portal, if a hacker were to gain your credentials, they can automated the SIM card swap. The next set of steps are for **TMobile**

3. Open the TMobile site, select **My Account**, then select **Log In**

    ![Tmobile login is displayed](media/tmobile-signin.png "Login to Tmobile")

4. Login using your phone number or username and then enter your password
  
    ![Tmobile login is displayed](media/tmobile-signin2.png "Login to Tmobile")

    > **NOTE** This can be automated and if your password has been `pawned` they can login to your account.

5. If you have setup Multi-factor authentication, you will be prompted for the following. Select **Continue**, then enter your code.

    ![Tmobile login is displayed](media/tmobile-mfa.png "Login to Tmobile")

    ![Tmobile login is displayed](media/tmobile-mfa-verify.png "Login to Tmobile")

6. Select **Account**

7. Select the phone line/device

8. Select **Change SIM**

9. At this point a hacker would enter a new SIM card either manually, or via automated means via an HTTP Post

### Task 2 : Setup MFA (Tmobile)

1. Select **My Account**, then select **Profile**
2. Select **T-Mobile ID**
3. On the bottom of the page, for **Google Authenticator** select **Set up**

    ![Tmobile login is displayed](media/tmobile-id.png "Login to Tmobile")

4. If you need too, download the Google Authenticator app. Select **Get Started**

    ![Tmobile login is displayed](media/tmobile-google-getstarted.png "Login to Tmobile")

5. With the Google Authenticator app, scan the bar code

    ![Tmobile login is displayed](media/tmobile-google-code.png "Login to Tmobile")

6. Enter the code displayed on your phone

    ![Tmobile login is displayed](media/tmobile-google-code-verify.png "Login to Tmobile")

7. Congrats, you are now more secure from SIM Card swap attacks!

    > **NOTE** You should attempt to do the same steps with your mobile provider.  If they do not offer two-factor authentication, you should consider switching to another provider.  Additionally, you should call the provider to ensure that no one is allowed to change your SIM card, this includes internal mobile provider employees.
